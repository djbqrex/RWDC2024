## Purpose

Scripts for pulling down and mapping restaurant week data in DC for 2024. This project was inspired by the shortcomings of the [official site](https://www.ramw.org/restaurantweek), particularly for visitors who are unfamiliar with the different neighborhoods in the area. The site has a cumbersome interface for accessing menus, and the map feature is non-functional. As a solution, I have developed a replacement map that may not have search functionality, but still offers valuable features for users who want to find restaurants in close proximity to their location.

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, run the following commands:

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install requests folium geopy beautifulsoup4
```

Make sure you have pip installed before running the command.
